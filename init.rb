# installation instructions. The basic problem is that ActionMailer will not
# look for templates in the plugin app/views directory. There weren't a 
# whole lot of options available and believe it or not, this was by far the
# very very very most shiny and pretty. Please I beg of you somebody step
# forward to prove me wrong!
